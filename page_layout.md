# Page Layout
Service Portal uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) layout by default. In order to add a widget, you must add first a container and then a row and a set of columns. But if you want to have a custom layout, for example you want to use flexbox instead of containers you can. Mark the *bootstrap alternative* option.
