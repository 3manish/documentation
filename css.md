#### CSS / SCSS
This is where you can write any custom styles that you want to apply to your widget. Any CSS rules that you write here are scoped to the widget â€“ this means that rules defined here effect the widget they are defined for and nothing else. Additionally, you can make use of many SASS/SCSS constructs, including variables, many mix-ins, and nested rules. For more, see our documentation and the SCSS documentation.
